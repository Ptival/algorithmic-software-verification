% Algorithmic Software Verification (Spring 2013)
% Introduction
% Ranjit Jhala, UC San Diego 

## What is Algorithmic Verification?

Algorithms, Techniques and Tools to ensure that

- Programs

- Don't Have

- Bugs

(What does that *mean* ? Stay tuned...)


## Topics

Most people here know what it means so more concretely...

1. Survey of *basics* of software verification          [me] 

2. Building up to *refinement type-based* verification  [me]

3. Culminating with *recent topics* in verification.    [you]


## Goals

1. Train students in state of the art, preparation for research

2. Write a monograph synthesizing different lines of work 


## Goals

1. *Use* tools for different languages to see ideas in practice

2. *Develop* ideas in a *single*, *unified*, *simplified* (aka "toy") PL

## Plan

- **Part 1** Deductive Verification

- **Part 2** Type Systems

- **Part 3** Refinement Types

- **Part 4** Abstract Interpretation

- **Part 5** Heap and Dynamic Languages

- **Part 6** Project Talks

## Plan: 1 Deductive Verification

- Logics & Decision Procedures 
- Floyd-Hoare Logic
- Verification Conditions
- Symbolic Execution

## Plan: 2 Type Systems

- Hindley-Milner 
- Subtyping
- Bidirectional Type Checking

## Plan: 3 Refinement Types

- Combining Types & Logic
- Reasoning about State
- Abstract Refinements

## Plan: 4 Abstract Interpretation

- Horn Clause Constraints
- Galois Connections
- Predicate Abstraction/Liquid Types
- Interpolation 

## Plan: 5 Heap & Dynamic Languages

- Linear Types
- Separation Logic
- HTT
- Dependent JavaScript

## Plan: 6 Project Talks

## Requirements & Evaluation

1. **Scribe**

2. **Program**

3. **Present**

## Requirements: 1. Scribe

- Lectures will be black-board (not slides)

- You sign up for one lecture (Online URL)

- For that lecture, take notes

- Write up notes in **LaTex** using provided **template**

## Requirements: 2. Program

About **three** "programming" assignments

- *Implement* some of algorithms (in Haskell)

- *Use* some verification tools (miscellaneous) 

## Requirements: 3. Present

You will present one **40 minute talk**

1. Select 1-3 (related) papers from **reading list**

2. Select presentation date (~ last 5 lectures)

3. Prepare slides, get vetted by me **1 week in advance**

4. Present lecture

- Can add other paper if I'm ok with it.
