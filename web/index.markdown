## Instructor

Ranjit Jhala `(jhala@cs.ucsd.edu)`

## Co-ordinates 

*Lectures:* Tu-Th 3:30 to 4:50 pm in CSE 2154

*Office Hours:* Tu-Th 5:00 to 6:00 pm in CSE 3110

## Description

The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive
type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas in roughly
two parts. First, we will study various high-level programming abstractions
through the lens of [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), 
a *pure functional* programming language that has been the
incubator for many recent PL advances. In the second part we will
see how the lambda calculus can be used to distill essence 
of computation into a few powerful constructs, and we will use it 
as a launching pad to study expressive type systems, logics and 
analyses that can make precise predictions about run-time behavior
at compile time. For more details see the [lecture](lectures.html) plan.


## Prerequisites

The class is mostly self contained. However, it will be *helpful* to have
some knowledge of basic discrete math, and it will be *essential* 
that you enjoy programming and have a desire to learn the material.

## Grading

- *Class Participation (20%)* : Keep up with readings.  
- *Homework Assignments (55%)* : About 5-6, mainly programming, done in pairs. 
- *Final (25%)* : Take home.
